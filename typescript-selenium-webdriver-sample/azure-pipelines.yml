# This file defines an Azure Pipelines build, which you can configure on https://dev.azure.com
# to run automatically with each Pull Request update and/or each commit to your repository.
# In this example, we do not change the default "trigger" behavior, so this build gets run
# for all commits/PRs to all branches of the axe-pipelines-samples repository.
#
# If you already have an Azure Pipelines build for your project, we recommend integrating
# your new accessibility tests into it, rather than creating a separate pipeline. Pipelines
# builds are usually defined in files like this one named "azure-pipelines.yml" or "build.yaml",
# but some projects use different file names.
#
# If you are using an Azure Pipelines build with tasks configured using the GUI on https://dev.azure.com,
# instead of a checked in YAML file, you can add the same tasks listed below from the GUI. However, we
# strongly recommend switching to using a checked in YAML file.
#
# Most TypeScript projects with an Azure Pipelines build will already have most of the steps
# shown below, with the exception of the final "PublishBuildArtifact" task; you'll probably
# have to add that.
#
# If you *don't* already have an Azure Pipelines build, we recommend following Azure Pipelines'
# documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline
# (using this sample as your starter code).
#
# For more information, see:
# * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started
# * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/customize-pipeline

pool:
  # The 'windows-2019' and 'vs20xx-windows' vmImages come pre-installed with selenium drivers for common browsers.
  # To use most other vmImages, you'll need to add a step to install these before running yarn test.
  # See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/continuous-test-selenium
  vmImage: 'windows-2019'

steps:
  # This task makes sure Node.js is installed on the build agent.
  #
  # It is a good idea to test against a specific, known version of Node; this makes it easier for other users
  # to reproduce your build results.
  - task: NodeTool@0
    displayName: install node 10.15.3
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '10.15.3'

  # This task installs dependencies specified in your package.json file.
  #
  # Our sample uses Yarn for this, but if your project uses NPM instead, that's also fine.
  #
  # Note that we add a specific command line option here to tell the "chromedriver" package to
  # use the preinstalled version of the Chrome webdriver that matches the preinstalled version of
  # Chrome on the hosted Microsoft build agent. The build agent comes with a "ChromeWebDriver"
  # environment variable pre-set to the location of the preinstalled chromedriver.exe. You would
  # typically omit this argument when running "yarn install" locally, since most users won't have
  # chromedriver preinstalled like the build agent will.
  - script: yarn install --frozen-lockfile --chromedriver_filepath=$(ChromeWebDriver) # or "npm install --ci"
    displayName: yarn install
    # workingDirectory should match where your package.json file is located. It defaults to the root of the repository.
    workingDirectory: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/typescript-selenium-webdriver-sample

  # This tasks runs the tests specified by jest.config.js, including our example accessibility tests.
  #
  # If your project already uses npm instead of yarn, or if your project already runs "jest" directly here,
  # those are both fine.
  #
  # The 2>&1 is a workaround for facebook/jest#5064
  - script: yarn test --ci 2>&1 # or "npm run test -- --ci 2>&1", or "jest --ci 2>&1"
    displayName: yarn test
    workingDirectory: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/typescript-selenium-webdriver-sample

  # This task is how the "Tests" tab in our Azure Pipelines build results page gets its data
  - task: PublishTestResults@2
    displayName: publish test results
    inputs:
      testResultsFiles: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/typescript-selenium-webdriver-sample/test-results/junit.xml
      testRunTitle: typescript-selenium-webdriver-sample
    condition: succeededOrFailed()

  # If you are adding tests to an existing project that already uses Azure Pipelines, this is probably the only
  # new task you'll need to add.
  #
  # This task is how the "Scans" tab in our Azure Pipelines build results page gets its data
  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    displayName: publish sarif results
    inputs:
      # The exact name "CodeAnalysisLogs" is required for the Sarif Results Viewer Extension for Azure Pipelines
      # to find the .sarif files our accessibility test produces.
      artifactName: 'CodeAnalysisLogs'
      # "test-results" is not a required convention; it just happens to be where our tests write .sarif files to.
      pathtoPublish: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/typescript-selenium-webdriver-sample/test-results'
    condition: succeededOrFailed()
