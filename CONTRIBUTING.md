# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

For larger contributions (eg, a new sample), we recommend starting out by filing an issue (use the "Suggestion" template) to discuss your idea with us first.

For small contributions (eg, a minor fix to an existing sample), feel free to just send a Pull Request.

## Pull Requests

Before sending a pull request, please double check that:

* Any new sample content being added is documented with a sample-level README.md and verbosely commented inline.
* The tests run and pass in each sample you're modifying.

Pull requests will be reviewed and merged by a member of the Accessibility Insights team.

## Contributor License Agreement

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
