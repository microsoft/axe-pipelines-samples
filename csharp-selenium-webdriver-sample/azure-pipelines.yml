# This file defines an Azure Pipelines build, which you can configure on https://dev.azure.com
# to run automatically with each Pull Request update and/or each commit to your repository.
# In this example, we do not change the default "trigger" behavior, so this build gets run
# for all commits/PRs to all branches of the axe-pipelines-samples repository.
#
# If you already have an Azure Pipelines build for your project, we recommend integrating
# your new accessibility tests into it, rather than creating a separate pipeline. Pipelines
# builds are usually defined in files like this one named "azure-pipelines.yml" or "build.yaml",
# but some projects use different file names.
#
# If you are using an Azure Pipelines build with tasks configured using the GUI on https://dev.azure.com,
# instead of a checked in YAML file, you can add the same tasks listed below from the GUI. However, we
# strongly recommend switching to using a checked in YAML file.
#
# Most C# projects with an Azure Pipelines build will already have most of the steps shown below
#
# If you *don't* already have an Azure Pipelines build, we recommend following Azure Pipelines'
# documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline
# (using this sample as your starter code).

# The browser automation tool we're using, Selenium, works with many different browsers. Here, we show
# an example of using the same test code with different combinations of browsers and OSes.

      imageName: windows-2019
      browser: chrome
    linux-firefox:
      imageName: ubuntu-16.04
      browser: firefox

pool:
  vmImage: $(imageName)

variables:
  # This will be sent to the build agent as an environment variable which our test code will be able to see.
  # We'll use this environment variable in WebDriverFactory.cs to determine which browser the tests will use.

  # This skips unnecessary steps during dotnet restore and saves ~30-60s

steps:
  # This task makes sure .NET Core SDK is installed on the build agent.
  #
  # It is a good idea to test against a specific, known version of .NET Core SDK; this makes it easier for other users
  # to reproduce your build results.

      command: restore

  # Using DotNetCoreCLI rather than a "script" step that runs "dotnet test" makes it easier to publish the test results
  # to see along with the rest of the build details in the Azure Pipelines web UI.

      # We use this EXTRA_DOTNET_TEST_ARGUMENTS variable in the sample's CI/PR builds so the "success" examples can --filter
      # out the tests that intentionally fail for example purposes. You probably don't need this in a real project.
